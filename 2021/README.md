# Purpose

In 2021 I decided to take on the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenge. Since this was my first year, I used primarily my strongest language - Typescript.

- [Day 2](./day2)

- [Day 17](./day17)

# Type system solutions only

I had an idea to try and solve Day1's first puzzle using types only. I wrote a blog about it [here](https://agalabov.github.io/advent-of-code-day-1-using-types). And since it actually worked I tried to test myself with the other puzzles as well:

- [Day 1](./type-system/day1)
- [Day 2](./type-system/day2)
