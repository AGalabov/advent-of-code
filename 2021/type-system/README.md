# Advent of Code 2021 using only types

Solving the puzzles using variables, loops and functions is cool and all. But have you tried using types only? I did!

I event wrote my first ever blog about it [here](https://agalabov.github.io/advent-of-code-day-1-using-types)

Here is my attempt at solving some of the advent puzzles using Typescript's typesystem only:

- [Types Library](./lib/index.ts)
- [Day 1](./day1)
- [Day 2](./day2)
