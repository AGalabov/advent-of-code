# Purpose

This year I decided to take on the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. Throughout the event I intend to use multiple languages, but primarily Typescript and C++, to go through the journey of obtaining all 50 start and saving Christmas.

# Solutions

- [Day 1](./day1)

# Type system solutions only

I had an idea to try and solve Day1's first puzzle using types only. I wrote a blog about it [here](https://agalabov.github.io/advent-of-code-day-1-using-types). And since it actually worked I tried to test myself with the other puzzles as well:

- [Day 1](./type-system/day1)
- [Day 2](./type-system/day2)
